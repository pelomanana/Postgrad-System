                <%--<p>What are the various streams in honours?
                CSC4016W: students not completed BSc majoring in Computer Science from UCT
                CSC4000W and CSC4003W: students with BCS (British Computer Society) accreditation
                CSC4000W: students with BSc in Computer Science from UCT
                CSC4003W: Busines Science students from UCT
                MAM4007W: Mathematics of Computer Science Honors programme run jointly by Mathematics department
                and the Computer Science department.</p>
                <p>What are the chances of acceptance?
                Space is limited to approximately 45 students, thus it depends on the level of
                other applicants in a particular year. If you have obtained an average of 65% or higher
                in your final years of CS and similarly good marks in undergraduate courses
                in Mathematics, then you are likely to be accepted. If your marks are less, your acceptance
                will be dependent on your motivation along with your marks.</p>--%>
